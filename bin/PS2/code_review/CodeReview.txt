A. Compile errors:
	1. All the package name should be "main.java.service".
	2. Import from Gson library seems unsolved, maybe wrong name.
	3. All the Gson related object names have problems.	
B. File structures:
	1. The "package-info.java" seems to make no sense.
C. Functionality:
	1. All the classes missing hashCode(), equals(), and toString().
	2. Missing NULL check everywhere.
	3. Shouldn't raise NullPointer exception while String has 0 length but valid.(PhoneNumber: #38)
	4. The white spaces in Note shouldn't be removed.
	5. The assert in Name class should be replaced with a throw sentence.(Name: #16)
	6. Lowercase checking for search not there.
	7. Member variables should be made final to avoid mutability.
	8. Trim should be used before the LIMIT check in Address class.(Address: #61, #69, etc.)
	9. The whole search scheme is redundant, every inherited class created a map only for one string word,
	but the whole search is built for various string words. The readability for this scheme is extremely low,
	and it doesn't perform well. A better approach is deleting the map and use count or normal find instead. 
	The populateSearchTerms and addWords should be thrown, and replaced by some simple search scheme.
	10. The function addJSONData should be declared static as it doesn't include any instances.(AddressEntry: #119)
	11. Function readAddressBook 
	12. There's no key in JsonObject for each created sub properties like Name, Note and etc.
	13. There's only one JsonObject for each created sub properties, thus addJSONData isn't needed.(AddressEntry: #35)
	14. Read operation should be replaced by a single set lastedId.(AddressBook: #41)
	15. There's no key stored in JsonObject as "zip", "address1" and etc, thus will fail on getString.(AddressBook: #152)
	16. Id for each AddressEntry isn't written to JsonObject.
	17. The commit from/to file synchorization scheme performs really bad, and it will large amount of time
	reading the file and reconstruct the addressbook.
	18. The function readAddressBook doesn't clear the content as it is expected.
	19. If two searched count equals, the former searched addressEntry will be overwritten. So map from int to
	addressEntry should be reversed.
	20. LatestId(version control) and entryId should be regarded as two integers.
D. Coding style:
	1. There may be some minor issues about new line and line-wrapping.	
E. Javadoc related:
	1. Missing params definition or name.(Note: line #14, AddressBook: line #129)
	2. Missing return params definition or name.(AddressEntry: line #94, #102)
	3. Some typos in every class.
