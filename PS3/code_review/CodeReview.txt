A. Functionality:
	1. There seems no need to implement equals() and hashCode() function for Stopwatch
	as it will always has unique ID.
	2. In getStopwatch() function in StopwatchFactory, synchronized may be used before
	accessing the stopwatchMap.
	3. In getLapTimes() function in StopwatchImpl, lapTimes should be deep copied before
	returned.
	4. In stop() function in StopwatchImpl, it can't call lap() directly as this will log
	the time in the lapTimes.
	
B. Javadoc related:
	1. @inheritDoc should be used to generate javadoc from the implemented interface.
